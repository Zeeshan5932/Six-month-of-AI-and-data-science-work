# **Training dataset:**


 ### The sample of data used to fit the model.

The actual dataset that we use to train the model (weights and biases in the case of a Neural Network). The model sees and learns from this data.



# **Validation set:**

The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration.




# Explain in easy and beginner level understandable
*
1. 📘 Training Set:*
   - This is like the textbooks and notes a student uses to study. The model learns from this.
*
2. 🧠 Model Learning:*
   - The model is like a student studying. It learns from the training set to get smarter.

*3. 🤖 Validation Set:*
   - This is like a practice quiz before the big exam. The model gets tested on new stuff it hasn't seen during training.

*4. 📊 Validation Results:*
   - The results of the practice quiz help us figure out how well the model is doing. But, the model doesn't "study" from this set.
*
5. ⚙️ Fine-Tuning:*
   - We adjust the model's settings (hyperparameters) based on the results of the practice quiz. It's like changing study habits for better results.

*6. 🚀 Development Stage:*
   - The validation set is like a buddy helping during the development or improvement stage of the model. It's known as the "Dev set."

So, the model learns from textbooks (training set), practices on a quiz (validation set), and we tweak how it studies (hyperparameter tuning) based on how it does on the quiz. The validation set is like a helpful friend during the development of our smart robot (or model)! 🤖✨
