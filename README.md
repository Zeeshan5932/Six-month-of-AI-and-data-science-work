**RMSE**: The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is one of the two main performance indicators for a regression model. It measures the average difference between values predicted by a model and the actual values. It provides an estimation of how well the model is able to predict the target value (accuracy)

*Accuracy*: Accuracy is a metric that measures how often a machine learning model correctly predicts the outcome. You can calculate accuracy by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions.

*MSE* : Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the amount of error in a statistical model. Evaluate the mean squared difference between observed and predicted values. If the model has no errors, the MSE is zero. Its value increases as the model error increases

*R`2`* : R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the goodness of fit of a regression model. The value of R-square lies between 0 to 1. Where we get R-square equals 1 when the model perfectly fits the data and there is no difference between the predicted value and actual value

*MAE* :  In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers to the magnitude of difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation.

*Recall* : Recall attempts to answer the following question: What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly? Mathematically, recall is defined as follows: Recall = T P T P + F N. Note: A model that produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0

*Precission* : 

*F1 score*: F1 score is a measure of the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Commonly used as an evaluation metric in binary and multi-class classification,

*confusion metrics* A confusion matrix is a table used in machine learning and statistics to assess the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the results of classification by showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictionspandoc
